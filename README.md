 #Threat-Detect 2XB3 
Project Uses the dataset containing 250000+ gun violence incidents from 2013 - 2018. The User is able to enter a location within the United States and a radius to represent the surrounding area, and the program will tell the user how dangerous or prone to gun violence the area is based on past statistics. This project demonstrates the use of advanced data structures (Balanced Binary Search Trees), advanced sorting algorithms (Quicksort), object oriented programming, and File I/O to parse and sort the large dataset.
